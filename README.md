Reporting Repository
=================

## Goal
The goal was to draft a Reporting Repository and submit an IETF best practice draft that hopefully results in an [RFC].

## Status
This idea was raised in the ICANN Registrar Stakeholder Group ([RrSG]) Technical and Operational ([TechOps]) Subcommittee and further discussed in the [CPH TechOps] Group.

This document is **not active** anymore. We abandoned it in favor of [Simple Registration Reporting].

## Validation of IETF draft
You may validate this [draft] document with https://tools.ietf.org/tools/idnits/.
