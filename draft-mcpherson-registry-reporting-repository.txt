Internet-Draft        Registry Reporting Repository            July 2018

1.  Introduction

   Modern top-level domain registries provide a number of detailed
   reports and documents that their registrars require on a daily,
   weekly and monthly basis. These most commonly include transaction
   reports, as well as lists containing currently unavailable domains
   and current premium domains. These reports are critical for
   registrars' businesses and play an important role in accounting and
   operations processes as well as in sales and marketing activities.
   In the current set-up registrars must download these reports from
   each registry's intranet in a different manner according to each
   registry's own document management set up.

   This document describes a standard domain Registry Reporting
   Repository used to provide reports to accredited domain registrars.

1.1.  Terminology and Definitions

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
   document are to be interpreted as described in [RFC2119] when
   specified in their uppercase forms.

1.1.1.  Internationalized Domain Names

   Names of affected hosts MUST be provided in Punycode according to
   [RFC5891].

1.1.2.  Dates and Times

   All dates and times attribute values MUST be expressed in Universal
   Coordinated Time (UTC) using the Gregorian calendar. The extended
   date-time form using upper case "T" and "Z" characters defined in ISO
   8601 [RFC3339] MUST be used to represent date-time values.

2.  Deploying a SFTP server

   Each domain name registry sets up and manages a SFTP server. Every
   SFTP server SHOULD be reachable through a generic URI, such as
   sftp://registry.example:22

   Each domain name registry SHOULD create one SFTP account for every
   accredited domain name registrar. If a registrar owns more than one
   registrar, then a registry MAY combine them in one account on
   request by the parent registrar.

3.  Directory Structure

   TBD

4.  Maintenance

   TBD

5.  IANA Considerations

   This document has no IANA actions.

6.  Security Considerations

   The standard Registry Reporting Repository described in this document
   do not provide any security services beyond those described by SFTP.
   The security considerations described in these other specifications
   apply to this specification as well.

7.  Implementation Status

   Note to RFC Editor: Please remove this section and the reference to
   [RFC7942] before publication.

   This section records the status of known implementations of the
   protocol defined by this specification at the time of posting of this
   Internet-Draft, and is based on a proposal described in [RFC7942].
   The description of implementations in this section is intended to
   assist the IETF in its decision processes in progressing drafts to
   RFCs.  Please note that the listing of any individual implementation
   here does not imply endorsement by the IETF.  Furthermore, no effort
   has been spent to verify the information presented here that was
   supplied by IETF contributors.  This is not intended as, and must not
   be construed to be, a catalog of available implementations or their
   features.  Readers are advised to note that other implementations may
   exist.

   According to [RFC7942], "this will allow reviewers and working groups
   to assign due consideration to documents that have the benefit of
   running code, which may serve as evidence of valuable experimentation
   and feedback that have made the implemented protocols more mature. It
   is up to the individual working groups to use this information as
   they see fit".

   Add implementation details once available.
